Microtubules are polymers of tubulin that form part of cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to eukaryotic cells. Microtubules can be as long as 50 micrometres, as wide as 23 to 27 nm[2] and have inner diameter between 11 and 15 nm.[3] They are formed by polymerization of dimer of two globular proteins, alpha and beta tubulin into protofilaments that can then associate laterally to form hollow tube, microtubule.[4] most common form of microtubule consists of 13 protofilaments in tubular arrangement.
