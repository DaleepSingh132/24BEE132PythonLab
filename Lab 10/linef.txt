Microtubules are polymers of tubulin that form part of the cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to eukaryotic cells.Microtubules play an important role in a number of cellular processes. Microtubules can be as long as 50 micrometres, as wide as 23 to 27 nm[2] and have an inner diameter between 11 and 15 nm. They are involved in maintaining the structure of the cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments, they form the cytoskeleton.[3] They are formed by the polymerization of a dimer of two globular proteins, alpha and beta tubulin into protofilaments that can then associate laterally to form a hollow tube, the microtubule. They also make up the internal structure of cilia and flagella.[4] The most common form of a microtubule consists of 13 protofilaments in the tubular arrangement. They provide platforms for intracellular transport and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the movement of secretory vesicles, organelles, and intracellular macromolecular assemblies.[5] They are also involved in cell division (by mitosis and meiosis) and are the main constituents of mitotic spindles, which are used to pull eukaryotic chromosomes apart.
